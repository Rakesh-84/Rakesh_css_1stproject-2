        <h1 style="color: aliceblue;">"There are a lot of reasons to travel. Some people travel for fun while some do it for education purposes. Similarly, others have business reasons to travel. In order to travel, one must first get an idea of their financial situation and then proceed.

            Understanding your own reality helps people make good travel decisions. If people gave enough opportunities to travel, they set out on the journey. People going on educational tours get a first-hand experience of everything they’ve read in the text.
            
            Similarly, people who travel for fun get to experience and indulge in refreshing things which may serve as 
            a stress reducer in their lives. The culture, architecture, cuisine and more of the place can open our mind to new thing".
